/** MATRICES IN THE KALMAN FILTER TEMPLATE
    (using the BasicLinearAlgebra library) **/

# To create a matrix, you first have to define an array and
# then define a matrix and assign the array to it.
# For example:

float arrayA[3][3] = {{ 1.0 , 2.0 , 3.0} ,
                      { 4.0 , 5.0 , 6.0} ,
                      { 7.0 , 8.0 , 9.0}};

# Now, you can convert an array to a matrix.
# For example:

Matrix<3,3> A = arrayA; 

# Also vectors are allowed.
# For example:

float arrayB[3] = {10.0 , 11.0 , 12.0};
Matrix<3> vectorB1 = arrayB;
Matrix<3,1> vectorB2 = arrayB;  # this is the same as the previous line

# You can obtain the numbers in a matrix by using indices. 
# Don't forget that indexing starts at 0 in C++!
# For example:

float a22 = A(2,2); # the element on the third (!) row and column

# Similarly, you could also assign numbers to the matrix.
# For example:

float c = 10.0; 
A(1,2) = c;

# The main purpose of using these Matrix objects is that they allow for
# basic linear algebraic operations that are not supported in standard C++.
# Manually implementing these would lead to very complex and ugly code. 
# For the Kalman filter, you'll mainly need these three:
# 1. Multiplication:

Matrix<3> product = A*vectorB1;

# 2. Sums and differences:

Matrix<3> difference = vectorB1 - vectorB2;

# 3. Transposes and inverses:

Matrix<3,3> invA = A.Inverse(); 
Matrix<1,3> transpB = vectorB2.Transpose(); 

# Just as for any other object, never forget to initialize your matrices.
# If you want to do this with zeros, this is easily done using the Fill command:

Matrix<4,7> C; # uninitialized matrix 
C.Fill(0);     # filled with zeros now
